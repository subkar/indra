The receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR binds the growth factor ligand EGF.
The EGFR-EGF complex binds another EGFR-EGF complex.
The EGFR-EGFR complex binds GRB2.
EGFR-bound GRB2 binds SOS1.

SOS1 bound to GRB2 binds NRAS.
NRAS, bound to SOS1 binds GTP.

NRAS bound to GTP binds BRAF.
BRAF that is not bound to NRAS binds BRAF.
BRAF, bound to NRAS binds BRAF, bound to NRAS.
BRAF that is not bound to BRAF binds Vemurafenib.
The BRAF-BRAF complex binds Vemurafenib.

BRAF that is not bound to Vemurafenib phosphorylates MEK1.
MEK1 phosphorylated is activated.
PP2A-alpha dephosphorylates MEK1.
Active MEK1 phosphorylates ERK2.
ERK2 phosphorylated is activated.
DUSP6 dephosphorylates ERK2.
Active ERK2 phosphorylates SOS1.
