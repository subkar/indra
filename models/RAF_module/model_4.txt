The receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR binds the growth factor ligand EGF.
The EGFR-EGF complex binds another EGFR-EGF complex.
The EGFR-EGFR complex binds GRB2.
EGFR-bound GRB2 binds SOS1 not phosphorylated.
GRB2-bound SOS1 not phosphorylated binds NRAS not bound to BRAF.
SOS1-bound NRAS binds GTP.
GTP-bound NRAS that is not bound to SOS1 binds BRAF.
BRAF binds BRAF.
Vemurafenib binds BRAF.
BRAF V600E that is not bound to Vemurafenib phosphorylates MAP2K1.
MAP2K1 phosphorylated is activated.
PP2A-alpha dephosphorylates MAP2K1 not bound to ERK2.
Active MAP2K1 that is not bound to PP2A-alpha phosphorylates ERK2.
ERK2 phosphorylated is activated.
DUSP6 dephosphorylates ERK2 that is not bound to SOS1.
Active ERK2 that is not bound to DUSP6 phosphorylates SOS1 not bound to NRAS.
Phosphatase dephosphorylates SOS1.
